RECOMMENDATIONS 

Encourage Sports participation as countries were not fully represented in the last games.

Under-performed countries in the last games should seek to sensitive their members on the importance of games like this, the perks and as well as the gains for the country at large. 

Their Governments should invest in sports development, to ensure that they have world standard facilities to enable their members prepare and perform better in the future.
